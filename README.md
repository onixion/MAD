#MAD - Network Monitoring Program

MAD is an opensource network monitoring software, which should become an alternativ version of Nagios, but shouldn't get as complex as Nagios. The main aim is to get a simple, esay-to-use, esay-understandable and nice-written C# program, which can analyse and managering a network.
